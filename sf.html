      <p>
        San Francisco, officially the City and County of San Francisco, is a cultural, commercial, and financial center
        of Northern California.
        Colloquial nicknames for San Francisco include The City, SF, Frisco and San Fran.
      </p>
      <p>
        San Francisco is located on the Northern Central Coast of California, roughly 400 miles north of Los Angeles
        and 400 miles south of Oregon.
        San Francisco is the 16th most populous city in the United States, and the fourth most populous in California,
        with 881,549 residents as of 2019.
        It covers an area of about 46.89 square miles (121.4 km2), mostly at the north end of the San Francisco
        Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area, making it the second most densely populated large U.S. city, and the
        fifth most densely populated U.S. county, behind only four of the five New York City boroughs. San Francisco is
        part of the 12th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States by population, with 4.7 million
        people, and the fourth-largest by economic output, with GDP of $592 billion in 2019.
        With San Jose, it forms the fifth most populous combined statistical area in the United States, with 9.67
        million residents as of 2019.

        alt="Sourdough Bread" class="restrict1" />
      <p>
        In a place where nourishment was scarce, bread starter (a dough that has fermented using naturally occurring
        bacteria and yeast)
        was a prized possession during the California Gold Rush, allowing miners to turn drab flour into loaves that
        were both nutritious and delicious.
        Somehow, the bread tasted tangier and more flavourful than it did elsewhere, and thus San Francisco sourdough
        was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than 170 years later, San Francisco is synonymous with sourdough bread. Patrons line up daily for
        fresh-from-the-oven loaves at
        Tartine Bakery in the city’s Mission District; and at The Mill, a whole-grain sourdough bakery and independent
        coffee shop just west
        of San Francisco’s famed “Painted Ladies” Victorians. Walk into any local market and you’ll find baskets filled
        with sourdough baguettes
        from the Bay Area’s own Acme Bread and Semifreddi’s; or make a stop at Boudin Bakery in the tourist hub of
        Fisherman’s Wharf, where
        steaming clam chowder comes served in carved-out loaves of the bakery’s own sourdough bread.

      <h3>Economy</h3>
      <p>
        San Francisco has a diversified service economy, with employment spread across a wide range of professional
        services,
        including financial services, tourism, and (increasingly) high technology. In 2016, approximately 27% of workers
        were
        employed in professional business services; 14% in leisure and hospitality; 13% in government services; 12% in
        education
        and health care; 11% in trade, transportation, and utilities; and 8% in financial activities. In 2019, GDP in
        the
        five-county San Francisco metropolitan area grew 3.8% in real terms to $592 billion. Additionally, in 2019 the
        14-county
        San Jose+San Francisco+Oakland combined statistical area had a GDP of $1.086 trillion, ranking 3rd among
        CSAs,
        and ahead of all but 16 countries. As of 2019, San Francisco County was the 7th highest-income county in the
        United
        States (among 3,142), with a per capita personal income of $139,405. Marin County, directly to the north over
        the
        Golden Gate Bridge, and San Mateo County, directly to the south on the Peninsula, were the 6th and 9th
        highest-income counties respectively.

          The historic center of San Francisco is the northeast quadrant of the city anchored by Market Street and the
          waterfront.
          It is here that the Financial District is centered, with Union Square, the principal shopping and hotel
          district, and the
          Tenderloin nearby. Cable cars carry riders up steep inclines to the summit of Nob Hill, once the home of the
          city's business
          tycoons, and down to the waterfront tourist attractions of Fisherman's Wharf, and Pier 39, where many
          restaurants feature
          Dungeness crab from a still-active fishing industry. Also in this quadrant are Russian Hill, a residential
          neighborhood
          with the famously crooked Lombard Street; North Beach, the city's Little Italy and the former center of the
          Beat Generation;
          and Telegraph Hill, which features Coit Tower. Abutting Russian Hill and North Beach is San Francisco's
          Chinatown, the oldest
          Chinatown in North America. The South of Market, which was once San Francisco's industrial core, has seen
          significant
          redevelopment following the construction of Oracle Park and an infusion of startup companies. New skyscrapers,
          live-work lofts, and condominiums dot the area. Further development is taking place just to the south in
          Mission Bay area,
          a former railroad yard, which now has a second campus of the University of California, San Francisco and Chase
          Center, which
          opened in 2019 as the new home of the Golden State Warriors.

        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>Bay Area Rapid Transit's, or BART's, all-electric trains are a fast, inexpensive, and dependable way to get
          from SFO to San Francisco easily and avoiding traffic. Once you have your luggage, follow the signs for
          AirTrain, a free tram service to all terminals. Take either the Red or Blue AirTrain line to the Garage G and
          BART stop in International Terminal G to take BART. BART fares are based on distance traveled; the greater the
          distance, the higher the fare. A round-trip fare from SFO to downtown San Francisco is $19.30 ($9.65 one-way).
          Buy your ticket at ticket machines at the SFO BART station. Then place your ticket at the designated slot on
          an entry faregate. When it pops out from the top slot, remove it to open the gate and board the San
          Francisco/Antioch train. When you arrive, repeat the same procedure to exit the station. If you don’t have
          enough value on your ticket to exit, don’t worry - you can add money to the ticket to exit at the Add Fare
          machine in the station. Clipper Multi-transit cards ($3 surcharge) are also available for purchase at
          designated ticket machines in BART stations. It can be used on BART and other transit systems including Muni
          buses and Street cars in San Francisco.</p>
          <img src="./res/sf_transportation.jpg" alt="San Francisco Transportation Statistics" class="restrict1" />
        <p>
          Muni is San Francisco’s bus and metro system that runs throughout the city, operating buses, trains, cable
          cars and the F-line heritage streetcar. Muni buses remain above ground and on streets while Muni Metro runs on
          rails and sometimes go underground. Bus stops come in many forms: small bus shelters, yellow paint on street
          poles, and white paint on streets. Metro stops can be found on an island in the middle of the street and in
          underground stations. Using the Metro Map, find the nearest Metro to your location. Find more information on
          how to use Muni and Muni Metro.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <section>
        <img src="http://bmart13.digitalscholar.rochester.edu/assignment03/images/SanFrancisco.jpeg"
        alt="Trans America Building" class="restrict" />
        <p>
          San Francisco was founded on June 29, 1776, when colonists from Spain established the Presidio of San
          Francisco at the Golden Gate and Mission San Francisco de Asís a few miles away, both named for Francis of
          Assisi. The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast
          at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856.
        </p>
        <h4>Notable Events</h4>
        <p>
          The California Gold Rush brought a flood of treasure seekers (known as "forty-niners", as in "1849"). With
          their sourdough bread
          in tow, prospectors accumulated in San Francisco over rival Benicia, raising the population from 1,000
          in 1848 to 25,000 by December 1849. The promise of great wealth was so strong that crews on arriving
          vessels deserted and rushed off to the gold fields, leaving behind a forest of masts in San Francisco
          harbor. Some of these approximately 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons and
          hotels; many were left to rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851, the harbor
          was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870, Yerba
          Buena Cove had been filled to create new land. Buried ships are occasionally exposed when foundations are dug
          for new buildings.
          California was quickly granted statehood in 1850, and the U.S. military built Fort Point at the Golden Gate
          and a fort on Alcatraz
          Island to secure the San Francisco Bay. Silver discoveries, including the Comstock Lode in Nevada in 1859,
          further drove rapid
          population growth. With hordes of fortune seekers streaming through the city, lawlessness was common, and
          the Barbary Coast
          section of town gained notoriety as a haven for criminals, prostitution, and gambling.

      <h3>Major Attractions</h3>
      <h4>Golden Gate Bridge</h4>
      <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/USCA/california-san-francisco-golden-gate-bridge.jpg"
        alt="Golden Gate Bridge" class="restrict" />
      <p>
        The Golden Gate Bridge is a California icon gracing San Francisco Bay. It is the most photographed site in the
        city, with
        the orange structure backed by blue water, or in many cases, peaking through low lying cloud. At night, the
        flood-lit
        structure is equally striking.
      </p>
      <h4>Alcatraz</h4>
      <p>
        The historic and notorious Alcatraz penitentiary, located on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, is one of
        America's
        most infamous prisons. It operated for almost thirty years, closing in 1963 and re-opening as a tourist
        attraction in
        1973. Some of America's most well-known criminals were inmates here, including Al Capone and the "Birdman," who
        would
        later form the basis for the fictional movie The Birdman of Alcatraz.
      </p>
      <h4>Cable Cars</h4>
      <p>
        Cable Cars were introduced in 1873 to help locals contend with the many hills the city is built on. Today, the
        few
        remaining cable cars offer tourists a great way to explore the city in historic fashion. Since 1964, these
        tram-like
        vehicles have had the unique distinction of being the only public transport system to be declared a historic
        monument.
