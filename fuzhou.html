      <img src="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/fujian/images/attachement/jpg/site1/20180823/286ed488c82f1ce85aad03.jpg" alt="Fotiaoqiang" class="restrict1" />
      <p>
        Fuzhou dishes are representative of the Min (which is short for Fujian Province) Cuisine that is
        very much a feature of Fujian Province and is one of the Eight Major Cuisines of China . One of the most
        renowned Fuzhou dishes is Fotiaoqiang (Buddha Jumps Over the wall). With more than 100 year's history,
        it is a traditional Min Cuisine recipe. It is said to have been created by the wife of a Fuzhou official,
        who in 1876 was entertaining an important member of the Fujian Government in his home. His wife, who was an
        excellent cook placed chicken, duck, pork and seafood together into an empty wine jar to simmer following a
        recipe which was known at the time as 'Full of Blessing and Longevity'. When the dish was served, the
        visitor praised the aroma and the delicious flavor and was so impressed that when he returned home he
        asked the cook – Zheng Chunfa to learn how the wife of his host had prepared the food. Subsequently,
        Zheng Chunfa adapted the recipe making it yet more fulsome and on the strength of his creation opened
        a restaurant named Juchunyuan where he served it to the delight of his customers. One day several
        talented writers to the restaurant and were served with Zheng Chunfa's special version of 'Full of
        Blessing and Longevity'. When he opened the jar in which it had been cooked, the diners were so
        taken with the gorgeous smell that one of them wrote a poem about it. In it he said that the smell
        was so wonderful that even a Buddha would stop pattering and jump over the wall to have a taste. Hence
        the name 'Buddha Jumps over the Wall'. Simmered in a Shaoxing wine jar using more than twenty ingredients
        including fish, sea cucumber, chicken, pork and mutton, dried scallop, sea-ear, needle of bamboo shoot and
        pigeon egg, this traditional dish is widely renowned overseas and is considered the top dish among those
        of the Min Cuisine.

        <p>
          The administrative divisions of Fuzhou have been changed frequently throughout history. From 1983, the Fuzhou
          current administrative divisions were formed officially, namely, 5 districts and 8 counties. In 1990 and 1994,
          Fuqing (Foochow Romanized: Hók-chiăng) and Changle (Foochow Romanized: Diòng-lŏ̤h) counties were promoted to
          county-level cities; Changle became a district in 2017. Despite these changes, the administrative image of
          "5 districts and 8 counties" is still held popularly among local residents. Fuzhou's entire area only covers
          9.65 percent of Fujian Province.
