      <h3>About Giza</h3>
      <img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/06/cio_middle_east_egypt_cairo_skyline_giza_pyramids_by_nirian_gettyimages-641697142_2400x1600-100799872-large.jpg" alt="Skyline" class="restrict"/>

        Giza is the second-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and
        fourth-largest city in Africa after Lagos, Kinshasa and Cairo. It is
        the capital of Giza Governate with a total population of 8.8 million
        as of October 2018. It is located on the west bank of the Nile, 4.9
        km southwest of central Cairo, and is a core city of the Greater
        Cairo metropolis. Giza is most famous as the location of the Giza
        Plateau, the site of the some of the most imporessive and ancient
        monuments in the world. Giza is a plateau southwest of modern Cairo
        which served as the necropolis for the royalty of the Old Kingdom of
        Egypt. Most famous for the pyramids of Khufu(completed in c. 2560
        BCE) and the Great Sphinx(built 2500 BCE),recent excavations on the
        plateau have revealed numerous private tomb complexes and workers'
        quarters. The original necropolis of Giza was laid out with amazing
        precision and skill but, once it became associated with the great
        kings of Egypt and their pyramids, attracted the attention of less
        prominent officals of lower rank. These officials had enough money
        and prestige to buy their way into burial plots at Giza but had no
        regard for the symmetry of the original schematics and had their
        tombs dug wherever they found available space. This resulted ina
        number of grave complexes throughout Giza which would not have been
        authorized by the kings who built the famous pyramids which,
        thorughout history, have drawn vistors from around the world.

        The Egyptians ate a low-fat, high-fiber diet with a lot of grains. 
        They ate a variety of plant oils and fats, bread, milk, lentils, cottage 
        cheese, cakes, onions, meat, dates, melons, milk products, figs, ostrich 
        eggs, almonds, peas, beans, olives, pomegranates, grapes, vegetables, 
        honey, garlic and other foods. The Egyptians ate a variety of grains, including 
        barely and emmer-wheat. The Egyptians cultivated barley, emmer wheat, beans, 
        chickpeas, flax, and other types of vegetables. Barley was used for making beer. 
        Emmer wheat was used to make bead. Lentils were discovered in an Egyptian tomb 
        dating back to 2000 B.C.).

        Tombs with mummies were often packed with food such as snails for the afterlife. 
        Rice arrived in Egypt in the 4th century B.C. and around that time India was exporting 
        it to Greece.The 4,900-year-old tomb of King Aha had three chambers and was stocked 
        with oxen meat, waterbirds, cheese, dried figs, bread and many vessels of beer and 
        wine for the afterlife journey. A small box found in tomb of King Tut contained 25 
        varieties of barely, each in its own compartment.

      <h3>Economy</h3>
      <p>Major imports and exports</p>

        Egypt’s economic freedom score is 55.7, making its economy the 130th freest in the 2021 
        Index. Its overall score has increased by 1.7 points, with improvements in 9 of the 12 
        categories of economic freedom. Egypt is ranked 11th among 14 countries in the Middle 
        East and North Africa region, and its overall score is below the regional and world averages.

        Although the Egyptian economy has been in the mostly unfree category since the inception 
        of the Index in 1995, the country improved its economic freedom score this year for the 
        third year in a row. To maintain that momentum, the government should pursue policy reforms 
        to reduce public debt and upgrade institutional performance to strengthen the three 
        rule-of-law indicators: property rights, judicial effectiveness, and government integrity.

        IMPACT OF COVID-19: As of December 1, 2020, 6,666 deaths had been attributed to the pandemic 
        in Egypt, and economic growth was forecast to decline to 3.5 percent for the year. Egypt has 
        nine preferential trade agreements in force. The trade-weighted average tariff rate is 9.0 
        percent, and 157 nontariff measures are in effect. A recently adopted investment code 
        consolidated investment-related rules, but investment in several sectors remains restricted. 
        The banking sector is well capitalized and stable, with local banks attaining continued profitability 
        and rating upgrades. The vibrant credit market is open to foreigners.

          New districts appeared with Schools, hotels, restaurants, banks, schools and commercial establishments. 
          In the early 20th century the ambitious project of the University of Cairo was born. A land located 
          near of the western bank of the Nile was chosen to be the New Cairo University, but actually and 
          geographically it is situated in the land of the city of Giza. This university is considered the 
          Mother University not only in Egypt but also in the Arab and African world. Then many embassies 
          were built in the city, especially in the city center and El Duqqi neighborhood. For geographic 
          and demographic reasons, today the city of Giza is a part of Greater Cairo, but administratively 
          are two separate provinces and each has its independent mayor and council: Greater Cairo contains 
          the entire Cairo, most of Giza and a part of Al-Qalyubia province located in the north of the present 
          Cairo. This region has about 20 million inhabitants.

        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
          Transport within Giza is by your own two feet for the most part. However, you will need to rely on 
          some sort of public or private transport to get to the pyramids of Giza. Most visitors arrive in 
          the area from Cairo. There are a number of buses that you can take from Cairo. The No 355/357 bus 
          route provides service from locations in Cairo to Giza. One of the most popular stops (albeit 
          unofficial) is behind the Egyptian Museum in Cairo where people gather to hop on the bus to Giza. 
          The No 355/357 buses are large, comfortable, and have air conditioning, a welcome luxury during the 
          hot days of summer. Bus fare costs around E£2.

          There is also microbus service to Giza. These buses are often very crowded and much less comfortable 
          that the normal bus service. Fares on the microbuses cost around 25 pt.

          A final option is to take a taxicab. A fare from downtown Cairo to Giza should cost around E£15. 
          To save some money (and beat traffic), you should consider taking the Cairo metro down to the Giza 
          stop, where you can hail a taxi for the E£5 fare to the pyramids.

        <h4>Notable Events</h4>
        <img src="https://www.tripsinegypt.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Giza-History-Trips-in-Egypt-1.jpg" alt="Giza's History" class="restrict" />
        <p>
          Giza city is the capital of Giza governorate. Officially, it was founded in the fourth century BC. 
          It was probably a small village since ancient times of Egyptian history that located in the center 
          of the way between Heliopolis and Memphis on the western bank of the Nile. The large capital 
          “Memphis” was the southern city of current Giza. Memphis was a major cultural and commercial center 
          throughout the time of Ancient Egyptian history. When Christianity flourished in Egypt, Memphis 
          lost much of its importance.
          
          After the Islamic conquest, Memphis was abandoned, but Giza received more value. It was well-fortified 
          by orders of the commander of the troops of the Arab conquest Amr Ibn Al-As. Great mosques were built 
          at Giza, but unfortunately, there was nothing left of them. Most of this area was agricultural lands, 
          and still has a considerable part of vegetation and agriculture activities in the province because of 
          the fertile land. From time to time, it was a target of floods of the Nile throughout its history, 
          especially in the low lands. For centuries, Giza was just a small town surrounded by rural villages 
          and small communities of farmers and fishermen.

      <h3>Major Attractions</h3>
      <h4>Great Sphinx of Giza</h4>
      <img src="https://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQO42ETh9sax342v30OlnYgHdSi_gSu7eibkL08BX0mG57tRM_nOl3FbrEbEI58zMXC4bGWNlh6sI788-EOY4qDwQ" alt="Great Sphinx of Giza" class="restrict" />
      <p>
        The Great Sphinx of Giza, commonly referred to as the Sphinx of Giza or just the Sphinx, is a limestone 
        statue of a reclining sphinx, a mythical creature. Facing directly from West to East, it stands on the 
        Giza Plateau on the west bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx is generally believed 
        to represent the pharaoh Khafre. Cut from the bedrock, the original shape of the Sphinx has been restored 
        with layers of blocks. It measures 73 m long from paw to tail, 20 m high from the base to the top of the 
        head and 19 m wide at its rear haunches. 
      </p>

      <h4>Giza Necropolis</h4>
      <p>
        The Giza Pyramid Complex, also called the Giza Necropolis, is the site on the Giza Plateau in Greater 
        Cairo, Egypt that includes the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure, 
        along with their associated pyramid complexes and the Great Sphinx of Giza. All were built during the 
        Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The site also includes several cemeteries and the 
        remains of a workers village. The site is at the edges of the Western Desert, approximately 9 kilometres 
        west of the Nile River in the city of Giza, and about 13 kilometres southwest of the city centre of Cairo. 
      </p>

      <h4>The Egyptian Museum</h4>
      <p>
        The Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, known commonly as the Egyptian Museum or Museum of Cairo, in Cairo, 
        Egypt, is home to an extensive collection of ancient Egyptian antiquities. It has 120,000 items, with a 
        representative amount on display and the remainder in storerooms. Built in 1901 by the Italian construction 
        company, Garozzo-Zaffarani, to a design by the French architect Marcel Dourgnon, the edifice is one of the 
        largest museums in the region. As of March 2019, the museum was open to the public. In 2021, the museum is 
        due to be superseded by the new Grand Egyptian Museum at Giza.
